## Dart Basics

- What is Dart?

  - Dart is an object-oriented programming language developed by Google.

  - This implies your code is not run as you write it, but instead it is parsed by a compiler and transformed (to machine code).
  - Dart has a few key features that it offers like almost other programming languages

    - Variables to temporarily store data
    - Functions to executed code “on demand”
    - Types to analyse your code before you run/ test it

  - Datatypes in dart: String, num, int, double, object, list, Sets

  - Objects & Object-orientation:

    - Dart is a programming language focused towards objects - that implies that all Dart values are the object. Even a simple number.

    - Objects are data structures. If you wish to make more intricate relationships between data or to encapsulate particular functionality in "one building block" you often construct your own objects.

  - Classes

    - Classes are data encapsulated with structure and behaviour. You use them when you have similar things that all behave the same way or all share meaning.

    - If you had a Dog class, well, all Dogs have a name, breed, colour, and all Dogs have the same behavior, barking, wagging, running.

  - Inheritance

    - “Inheritance” means that a class can be based on another class (and only one one other class, not on multiple classes).

- [Dartpad](https://dartpad.dev/) is an online code editor for the Dart language. In addition to executing regular Dart programs, it can run Flutter programs and show graphic output.

- In the code folder you may find several basic programmes.

## Overview of Folders Generated by Flutter

- Flutter project consists folders as shown in below snapshot.

  1. Build cache is generated on application run time when a temporary file automatically generated in .dart_tool folder, android folder and iOS folder.

  2. `.dart_tool` contains a `package_config.json file` that specifies packages' locations and versions, as well as Flutter build caches (in a `flutter_build directory`). The `.dart_tool` directory, which is new in Dart 2, is used by pub and other tools. It replaces the `.pub` directory as of the 2.0.0-dev.32.0 SDK release.

  3. The `.idea` folder will be containing all setting related to the IntelliJ IDEA Android studio.

  4. The `Android and iOS folders` contain code for building an app on Android and iOS, respectively. Android folder and ios folder are the folders in which an app can actually be built on the platform of Dart files. They also help you add platform specific features and permissions to your project. When you run a Flutter project, it creates a Gradle or XCode based on the emulator or the device that it is using. `In short, those folders are entire apps which set the stage for the Flutter code to run.`

  5. The `build` folder is the holding the compiled code of your Flutter application. The content of this folder is automatically generated as part of the Flutter build process, so that you don’t need to change anything manually inside this folder.

  6. `Lib` folder will include all dart files for our flutter project and most of us will work in this folder.

  7. The `test` folder contains code that is written to perform an automated test when building for the Flutter application.

  8. `web` folder is for web-app build.

## Overview of Files Generated by Flutter

  1. The purpose of `.gitignore` file is to ensure that certain files not tracked by Git remain untracked.

  2. This file tracks properties of this Flutter project. Used by Flutter tool to assess capabilities and perform upgrades etc.

  3. `.packages` file is deprecated. Tools should instead consume `.dart_tools/package_config.json`.

  4. `.iml` is a module file created by IntelliJ IDEA.

  5. `pubspec.lock` specifies the concrete versions and other identifying information for every immediate and transitive dependency a package relies on. The lockfile is generated automatically for you by pub when you run pub get, pub upgrade, or pub downgrade.

  6. Flutter creates a `pubspec.yaml` for a basic Flutter app.

  7. `README.md` is a file that contains programme, utility or APP information for the user. README files often include instructions and additional help, and patch or update details.
